# Buffett True-Cost Calculator

## Background and Motivation
This is a web application that calculates the true cost of purchases by showing how much money would grow if invested until retirement age instead of being spent. It's based on Warren Buffett's philosophy of considering the opportunity cost of spending money that could otherwise be invested. The name and quote suggest it's inspired by Buffett's famous quote about haircuts costing thousands of dollars when considering the potential investment returns.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- The application uses compound interest calculations to show how money grows over time
- Supports different purchase frequencies (one-off, daily, monthly, yearly)
- Includes a visualization component (sparkline chart)
- Has a responsive design with dark mode support
- Fixed CSS linter error
- Implemented multilingual support (English default, Spanish for ES language browsers)
- Removed decimal places from currency formatting to show whole numbers only

### Multilingual Support Analysis
For a static HTML/JS application like this one, here are the key considerations for adding multilingual support:

1. **Content that needs translation:**
   - All static text (headings, labels, buttons, FAQs)
   - Number formatting (currency symbols, thousand separators, decimal points)
   - Date formatting (if applicable)
   - Quote from Warren Buffett

2. **Implementation options:**
   - **JavaScript-based translation:** Create a translation dictionary/object for all text content and swap content based on detected language
   - **HTML lang attributes:** Use the lang attribute to specify language of content for accessibility and proper rendering
   - **Browser language detection:** Use `navigator.language` or `navigator.languages` to detect user's preferred language

3. **Best approach:**
   Given this is a client-side only application with no build process evident, a JavaScript-based translation system with automatic language detection would be the most straightforward approach.

## High-level Task Breakdown
1. Fix the CSS linter error on line 48 in index.html (extra curly brace in `summary::-webkit-details-marker{{display:none;}}`)
2. Review the compound interest calculations for accuracy
3. Verify the visualization implementation
4. Test responsiveness and dark mode
5. Consider any enhancements or additional features
6. Implement multilingual support:
   a. Create a translation dictionary for English and Spanish
   b. Implement language detection based on browser settings
   c. Create a function to apply translations to the DOM
   d. Add a language toggle for manual selection
   e. Ensure number formatting is appropriate for each language
   f. Test with different browser language settings
7. Remove decimal places from currency formatting

## Project Status Board

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
Fixed the CSS linter error on line 48 by removing the extra curly brace in the details marker styling. The correct syntax is now `summary::-webkit-details-marker{display:none;}`.

Implemented multilingual support with the following features:
- Added translation dictionaries for English and Spanish
- Added automatic language detection based on browser settings
- Created UI toggle buttons for language selection
- Updated the formatter for currency display based on locale
- Modified tooltip display to use localized text
- Set document lang attribute for accessibility

Modified currency formatting to show whole numbers without decimal places by setting `minimumFractionDigits` and `maximumFractionDigits` to 0 in the Intl.NumberFormat options.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
I've successfully implemented multilingual support for the Buffett True-Cost Calculator. The implementation includes:

1. A language toggle in the top-right corner (EN/ES buttons)
2. Automatic detection of browser language on page load
3. Complete translations for all text elements
4. Proper number formatting for currency values based on locale

I've also removed the decimal places from all currency displays in the application by configuring the Intl.NumberFormat formatter with `minimumFractionDigits: 0` and `maximumFractionDigits: 0`. This applies to both the main result display and the tooltip values.

All currency values now appear as whole numbers without cents (e.g., "$1,234" instead of "$1,234.00"), making the display cleaner and more focused on the significant figures.

Would you like me to proceed with testing the multilingual support in different browser language settings or move on to another task?

## Lessons
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output
- Read the file before editing it
- Run npm audit to check for vulnerabilities
- Always ask before using the -force git command
- When implementing multilingual support, use data attributes (data-i18n) to make translation application easy and maintainable
- For currency formatting, Intl.NumberFormat provides locale-aware formatting with configurable decimal place options
